    <h3>A little bit about me</h3>
    
    <p>I was born on May 29th, 1995, in Birmingham, Alabama. I was raised in Leeds, in the same state. After I graduated high school from Pelham, I signed a six-year contract and enlisted in the United States Air Force. 
        At the end of my contract, I decided to leave the USAF and try to obtain a BSN in Nursing. I got into the nursing program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham but soon found out it was not for me. 
        I choose Computer Science, and I can conceptualize and compartmentalize the subject material. Kind of figures coming from the son of a civil engineer.</p><br><br><br>
